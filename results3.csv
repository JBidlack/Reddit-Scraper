0,Help Me Write My Resignation Letter,"Welp, I’ve finally had it. My job has officially broken the camels back, so to speak. They are now going to be “randomly auditing” employees, meaning they’re going to pick one random employee and watch them fervently on the cameras to see if they’re committing “time theft”. 
What counts as time theft, you ask?
• Sitting down
• Using your phone (which we have to use for work, makes no sense)
• Talking with fellow employees too much
• Too many bathroom breaks
• Too many water breaks
• Eating while not on break

So yeah, I’m done. This is degrading and dehumanizing. I don’t have another job lined up and I honestly don’t care. I want to write a letter that calls them out for their toxic behavior but in a professional way. There was a resignation letter someone posted on this sub a few weeks ago that had some really great points I wanted to use, but I can’t find it and apparently didn’t save it. 
If anyone would be willing to help me out, it would be much appreciated. 💜

EDIT: Since a few of you have asked, here’s a short list of some of the other reasons I’m done.

• Cut my hours frequently without warning
• Make changes to the schedule with less that 24-48 before the work day
• I was the only employee that wasn’t notified when our GM got fired a few weeks ago, still haven’t had an official explanation from HR about what happened
• Hired an older white man whose been there 6 months as the new GM over a younger native woman whose been the assistant manager since the store opened and has busted her ass for them and has a business degree (no, it’s not me. And I’m not the only employee who is mad about this, most of us are)
• Tried to “promote” me to a new position, but oh wait the position doesn’t ACTUALLY exist and there’s no pay raise, just more responsibilities (this is realistically when I should have quit)
• Refuse to accommodate myself and others who are disabled/have chronic health conditions
• Constantly changing their company policies and not communicating the changes with us unless we violate them, so none of us know what is correct anymore or not
• HQ refuses to wage compete with our competitors or offer significant raises despite inflation (the company makes at least six figures a day with just slightly over 100 employees, so there’s no reason they couldn’t pay us more other then being greedy)
• Denied an employee his paternity leave even tho it states in their policies that they offer it

So yeah. This has been a long time coming.",2023-02-12 15:09:35
1,I think my boss is the devil,"

TW: death

(Sorry for format issues, on my phone)

The context:

-I used to be an apprentice body piercer 

-I currently work in a VERY small venue with a bit of a skeleton staff. We had to close for the day when the head chef was sick



The characters:

Angel Manager - AM - friend of mine who’s been very understanding 

Demon Boss - DB - owner of the venue


The story:

About 3 weeks ago I lost a close friend of mine. It was very sudden and unexpected (we still don’t really know what happened but it seems like it was a medical issue) and I’m struggling. I’m ‘lucky’ enough to have not experienced loss like this before. I’m not close with my family so I’m big on found family and my friend was that to me.


So far I’ve taken 4 days off. Last week I took a Wednesday off. I’m taking the funeral and day after off (next week) and I took yesterday off because I started crying during the close on Thursday. I came back in today and AM told me that DB had said it was ‘quite cheeky’ of me to take a Friday off. Sorry I couldn’t plan my breakdown better? He came into the venue after having taken a few weeks off and I decided to just avoid him. He’s been talking about getting his nipple piercered. He came up to me later:


‘Hey OP, so will you pierce my nipple?’

‘No…’

‘Why? Afraid I’ll cry?’

‘I don’t work in a studio anymore, it’s unsafe’

‘Oh come onnnnnn’

‘Nope’


He runs off to AM’


‘Well OPs a fucking barrel of smiles today!’

‘….OPs had a bereavement a couple weeks ago…’

‘They can’t be like that at work!’

‘They’ve been grand with customers’

‘Fuck me I’m just the owner I guess’ and he stormed away


I understand it’s been tricky for AM to get cover when I’ve called in last minute but DB has been on holiday the last few weeks? I don’t even think I was rude to him. Maybe a bit distant but at the very least neutral. We were in the back weren’t even any customers to here us.


Not looking for advice or anything, just the validation of internet strangers going ‘what the fuck’


Because honestly…what the fuck?!?",2023-02-11 20:07:30
2,Credits to ChatGPT," 

Verse 1: The exploitation of employees, it's such a shame Bosses cutting corners just to boost their own gain Paying minimum wage, no benefits or respect Employees are expendable, just a line item to neglect

Chorus: Exploitation of employees, it's a corporate game Profit margins over people, it's a real damn shame We gotta fight for workers' rights, it's time to stand up tall Together we can make a change, and demand fair treatment for all

Verse 2: It's not just low wages, it's the unpaid overtime Expecting workers to go above and beyond, it's a crime Working long hours, without breaks or rest Ignoring basic needs, it's a management test

Chorus: Exploitation of employees, it's a corporate game Profit margins over people, it's a real damn shame We gotta fight for workers' rights, it's time to stand up tall Together we can make a change, and demand fair treatment for all

Verse 3: It's time to call out the exploitation and the greed No more turning a blind eye, it's time to take the lead Let's demand a living wage, safe working conditions too Because the exploitation of employees, it's not something new

3,Is this a micromanager,"Me: takes lunch and goes to a 30 minute meeting then checks email and attends to bosses needs. 

Boss: why wasn’t this handled earlier

Me: the email came through while I was on lunch and then I went straight to the meeting checked emails and handled accordingly.

Boss: you should have went to your meeting later, this was more important.

Me: you could have called or handled it. (It took like 2 mins to do if that) 

Boss: I asked you to do it.

Boss: created a fake scenario in which the worse case scenario happens if I don’t handle. 

Me: still going back and forth. 

I dealt with this for a year with glimmers of kindness here and there. Was I micromanaged? After being let go, I’m trying to heal and take accountability but also trying to see if this is normal?",2023-02-11 16:34:04
4,Why must the retirement age be raised? It's the stock market,"Pensions can take many forms: 401k, social security, thrift savings plan etc.

But they all come down to one thing, your pension is, to some degree, invested in stocks. It may be anywhere from a small portion to the entire pension but you get the idea.

As the stock market grows, it requires more and more investors in order to keep it a float. That means that you can't allow people to retire on time, because they would withdraw their savings too quickly.

So the retirement age has to be raised again and again, to prevent stock prices going into free fall.

This has wider consequences for other policy decisions. 

Look at all the state/federal redundancies we've seen in recent years:

* Police
* Firemen
* Military
* Teachers

What do they all have in common? They generally retire at 50 - 55 years old. That's too early! If all those people started selling their stocks, the market would collapse. So the government tries to layoff as many of those people as they can, and tells everyone that it's due to 'efficiency savings'.

You/we will work longer to prop up stocks, that's what they have planned.",2023-02-11 08:55:59
5,Former employer is threatening to sick attorney on me based off a reddit comment I made,"So my local community reddit page asked for preschool suggestions. I offered only this bit of wisdom:

""Wouldn’t recommend La Petite Playschool. Owner told me she’d remove any negative reviews online. Also leaves 1 adult with 6 two years old and 1 seven month old.

Source: I worked there""

Since I made that comment the owner of the preschool has created a reddit, just to defend themselves  and I quote ""if I am able to find out whom wrote this, they will be contacted via my attorney.""

&#x200B;

[Screenshot of comment (last bit of it)](https://preview.redd.it/kxi9sg4qfgha1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5859778f47c5ffbb84c85d0ffd5d27f43d62ec3)

This whole I work 50-60 hours is debatable to me. In my time there, she only came out of her upstairs residence when parents were around. As soon as they left she was back upstairs. Charges about $1000 per month for 5 days a week, her most recent post on indeed offers $14-$17 an hour. Glad she can afford all the litigation she is trying to start on Reddit.

About the comment that started this all, I am only saying what I experienced while I was there and what I was told (I don't know how one goes about removing internet content)

——-—————————————————————

Edit: Update: so that response has since been deleted and TWO new accounts only hours old one created at 1:00am and 2:00am. Have responded to my original post (in my local community page) singing praises to the business and essentially calling me a liar. As I said below. I am living rent free in this person’s head

Edit again:

I can’t believe how many x-hours old accounts are sending messages. Lisa chill out.

I just got two new ones.

Edit again!

Yes, another edit, you guys should be pleased to hear that my former employer has infiltrated this reddit post. Here is one of the accounts that posted here and then bailed. Keep in mind I've got like 6 accounts messaging me.

6,Retaliation against workers post-strike by UC,"Hey y'all 

&#x200B;

Hope everybody's been doin alright. 

You might remember some of the posts from this acc a few months back sharing some of the pictures from strike events at UCSD, part of the broader UC student worker strike. [Fairucnow.org](https://Fairucnow.org)

Posting today to notify and warn others about retaliatory behavior which is conducted during strike and even post-strike.

In this case, students are being pressured out of the school after years of PhD work, via 'unsatisfactory' grades on their research credits.

To be clear, we still have responsibility to pass our own classes during strike to remain in 'good academic standing'; however, the credits in question are essentially filler credits which are tied to their labor for the university as researchers.

This boils down to retaliation against striking workers, and a threat to future labor activists that UC is willing to blatantly break labor law to punish them for striking

As we move forward, a huge part of protecting each other post-strike is fighting these types of abuses and filing grievances as UC fails to follow the negotiated and ratified contracts

The fight rages on against abuses like these

Check out more info from [https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2023/02/06/uc-san-diego-graduate-workers-file-complaints-of-retaliation](https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2023/02/06/uc-san-diego-graduate-workers-file-complaints-of-retaliation)

There's also some other stories around the media, take care to critically examine the framing of the media story regarding labor activity before accepting their narrative

7,I regret taking a sick day.,"Good morning, everyone

I have been battling with a cold all week. I’m feeling better now though! Yesterday, I called out because I couldn’t breathe through my nose. I barely got sleep because of it. I feel good to go back to work now. My manager called and asked if I could cover someone’s shift this evening. From what I’ve gathered, no one covered for me. From my previous posts on here, I also don’t cover shifts. They passed it off as, “You can get more rest that way!” Yeah, no. It’s a closing shift. I have assignments to catch up on too. Also, I’ll get more rest if I work my midday shift.",2023-02-10 11:09:57
8,Micromanagement?,"I'm making this post a sort of a Aita style and could use some insight.

Groundwork: I work for a tmc or travel management company, that handles corporate clients. It's a travel arm of a bigger financial corporation. I'm on a team that handles one specific company and nothing else. The client company is also a financial based company that I do have the question of impropriety but that's another matter all together

Main issue: As an hourly worker I make theost I've ever made previously at 24 an hour, no I know from the jump there are thousands of people who don't make nearly as much, but that amount of money comes with a lot of hassle. I work from home using their computer. I have health insurance and a 401 k which is meh but i digress.  

They have a system in place that is a tracking software of when your in available status and when your not giving you alerts to when to take your break or if your exactly on time,/late and if you're over on any metric tells you that an email is being sent to your leader like some sort of threatening posture. This pop up on your screen also asks if your on hold with a vendor after 2 minutes and tells you if you aren't go back to the client and if you are on hold for an airline to use their website. 

The PTO process is a nightmare they have an allotment calendar show how many hours workforce has for people to take PTO, to which they swear by but don't tell you that if they fall below a 80 percentage service level threshold, that calendar doesn't matter so your request will stay pending, even for doctors appointments there's no way to see what that level is. I have a lot of health issues and may need frequent appointments in a month like right now I need some teeth pulled but I can't planned it out because of being told about the service level.

In essence I'm stuck in two schools of thought, one is hey your making a decent amount and your the breadwinner of your home suck it up, the other half is like I shouldn't die for this job that via management and training doesn't give a shit about me as a human. Oh I forgot to mention with all of the bookings and and changes I do of itineraries which is in a dos based system designed by American airlines in the late 80s, I make zero commission.
