0,Why must the retirement age be raised? It's the stock market,"Pensions can take many forms: 401k, social security, thrift savings plan etc.

But they all come down to one thing, your pension is, to some degree, invested in stocks. It may be anywhere from a small portion to the entire pension but you get the idea.

As the stock market grows, it requires more and more investors in order to keep it a float. That means that you can't allow people to retire on time, because they would withdraw their savings too quickly.

So the retirement age has to be raised again and again, to prevent stock prices going into free fall.

This has wider consequences for other policy decisions. 

Look at all the state/federal redundancies we've seen in recent years:

* Police
* Firemen
* Military
* Teachers

What do they all have in common? They generally retire at 50 - 55 years old. That's too early! If all those people started selling their stocks, the market would collapse. So the government tries to layoff as many of those people as they can, and tells everyone that it's due to 'efficiency savings'.

You/we will work longer to prop up stocks, that's what they have planned.",2023-02-11 08:55:59
1,"7 jobs in 2022: Have work cultures changes since the ""Before Times""?","I am willing to say, ""it's me""?

However

since the Pandemic, I've noticed a low grade depression among workers.  Just a personality-less zone of ppl who visibly hate their jobs, their lives etc

Gone is the playfulness & energy...

I can't w the dour faces and lack of humour. 

Also, if co-workers can't clean up after themselves I CAN'T. 

Here are the jobs I've quit & why:

1. male supervisor who yell talked and or actually just screamed when upset
2. hungover man clique whose feet stunk up the whole office
3. 1st day on job, it appeared soup had been spilled on my new desk and chair.  barely wiped up and when I asked about it, supervisor said, ""oh that's been there a week, probably dry by now""
4. employee bathroom a scary biohazard, a la, bodega bathroom
5. random pay cuts from 10 to 50 dollars/day
6. 3 19yo & single pregnant co-workers who blasted music and complained about baby daddies 
7. dust so thick, all office chairs looked fur covered- except it was dust. 

Now on 8th job that's -AT LEAST CLEAN W A CLEANING TEAM- yet culture is dour & humourless despite it being an high end corporation. 

F with this.  I'm nearly ready to quit again, but in last position, was there for 20 years up to 2019l

2,Retaliation against workers post-strike by UC,"Hey y'all 

&#x200B;

Hope everybody's been doin alright. 

You might remember some of the posts from this acc a few months back sharing some of the pictures from strike events at UCSD, part of the broader UC student worker strike. [Fairucnow.org](https://Fairucnow.org)

Posting today to notify and warn others about retaliatory behavior which is conducted during strike and even post-strike.

In this case, students are being pressured out of the school after years of PhD work, via 'unsatisfactory' grades on their research credits.

To be clear, we still have responsibility to pass our own classes during strike to remain in 'good academic standing'; however, the credits in question are essentially filler credits which are tied to their labor for the university as researchers.

This boils down to retaliation against striking workers, and a threat to future labor activists that UC is willing to blatantly break labor law to punish them for striking

As we move forward, a huge part of protecting each other post-strike is fighting these types of abuses and filing grievances as UC fails to follow the negotiated and ratified contracts

The fight rages on against abuses like these

There's also some other stories around the media, take care to critically examine the framing of the media story regarding labor activity before accepting their narrative

3,I regret taking a sick day.,"Good morning, everyone

I have been battling with a cold all week. I’m feeling better now though! Yesterday, I called out because I couldn’t breathe through my nose. I barely got sleep because of it. I feel good to go back to work now. My manager called and asked if I could cover someone’s shift this evening. From what I’ve gathered, no one covered for me. From my previous posts on here, I also don’t cover shifts. They passed it off as, “You can get more rest that way!” Yeah, no. It’s a closing shift. I have assignments to catch up on too. Also, I’ll get more rest if I work my midday shift.",2023-02-10 11:09:57
4,Micromanagement?,"I'm making this post a sort of a Aita style and could use some insight.

Groundwork: I work for a tmc or travel management company, that handles corporate clients. It's a travel arm of a bigger financial corporation. I'm on a team that handles one specific company and nothing else. The client company is also a financial based company that I do have the question of impropriety but that's another matter all together

Main issue: As an hourly worker I make theost I've ever made previously at 24 an hour, no I know from the jump there are thousands of people who don't make nearly as much, but that amount of money comes with a lot of hassle. I work from home using their computer. I have health insurance and a 401 k which is meh but i digress.  

They have a system in place that is a tracking software of when your in available status and when your not giving you alerts to when to take your break or if your exactly on time,/late and if you're over on any metric tells you that an email is being sent to your leader like some sort of threatening posture. This pop up on your screen also asks if your on hold with a vendor after 2 minutes and tells you if you aren't go back to the client and if you are on hold for an airline to use their website. 

The PTO process is a nightmare they have an allotment calendar show how many hours workforce has for people to take PTO, to which they swear by but don't tell you that if they fall below a 80 percentage service level threshold, that calendar doesn't matter so your request will stay pending, even for doctors appointments there's no way to see what that level is. I have a lot of health issues and may need frequent appointments in a month like right now I need some teeth pulled but I can't planned it out because of being told about the service level.

In essence I'm stuck in two schools of thought, one is hey your making a decent amount and your the breadwinner of your home suck it up, the other half is like I shouldn't die for this job that via management and training doesn't give a shit about me as a human. Oh I forgot to mention with all of the bookings and and changes I do of itineraries which is in a dos based system designed by American airlines in the late 80s, I make zero commission.

5,Why don't Americans move out?,"Ok guys thats enough, thanks for your responses. The reason why I was so centric on moving instead of promoting change with in the US is because I do believe change isn't coming for the US specifically, only option is to figure out somesort of way to move out. I would lock this post but I can't. 



Original post:
Ive seen the absurd prices, the crazy medical care and fees, the low low wages, some are forced to rely on tips, even crazier rent, the amount of unhealthy additives thrown into the average product etc. 

I'm in England, I could go on and on but for what reason do you guys not move out? Is it for family, for debt or your passport doesn't allow you? 

Thanks.

Edit: Alot of comments repeating, please read some of my replies. Question is aimed at those who can move but choose not to, sorry I wasn't clear. There's so many angles to this topic, I cant possibly account for them all, my bad still.

1. I'm not trying to make it sound easy
2. Yes it's tough but more viable to some and not viable for others
3. Yes expensive I know but worth it in the long run. 
4. England is not that much better but just giving context. Still better then America in every way, free healthcare, benefits, way less gun crime, free cost of living payments for those who need it etc. Yes this could change, and we are going on strike and things are uncertain but is it not still better then America, there are still other countries as well.
5. Yes, I know immigration is way more strict/ you need a set of skills but I truly believe there is still always a way unless money or family and friends are an issue for you.
6. America will never change, it is too too divided. Yes there are unions and strikes but still too small of a percentage.

My question was aimed at those who are able to move but haven't but I didn't put that in because I wanted to leave it a bit open but I didn't realize it may have come across as being privileged or something of the sort.",2023-02-09 04:45:30
6,Blatant sexism in the entire ellive event industry in utah,"So my girl and I work in the corporate live events industry in Utah and there's like 3 big companies that actually produce those big 10s of thousands of people events

Then they pay a mix of labor companies and individuals on 1099 contractor basis which is another giant pain in the ass that's definitely seudo illegal but not the current issue

So labor coordinator from labor company X (call her Brittany calls me and we're friendly enough that she unloads some information about why me and my girlfriend haven't been getting as much work lately. 

Apparently she's been friends with the labor coordinator from the main big company (Karen) for a decade or more and they talk still but apparently Karen HATES MY GUTS for unknown reasons (I've had very few interactions with her and I've never fucked up an event or given her reason to feel that way) and won't let my GF on any gigs because her new boyfriend (Steve) either expressed interest in my GF or possibly she just thought my GF was prettier than her Brittany couldn't decide what the deal was but dropped that bomb on my lap and just moved on to other random topics.

For context the winter time always sucks for our industry there's no work there's no unemployment benefits there's no savings we really fucking struggled and her struggles began in like October inexplicably and it's now middle of February before she gets another gig.

On top of all that she's an attractive human that's spent the better part of 5 years learning how to be excellent at this job that she loves all while getting sexually harassed by every gross meth head looking burnout 50 year old on the crews and or running them and never once been treated like a valid technician and given the same respect her male peers enjoy. Including constantly getting looked over for higher level positions she's over qualified for.

So I had to tell my GF what was going on despite feeling horrible about it and wishing I could shield her from that wound, we started discussing how illegal that shit is and how we would ever begin to bring this to a judge and realized if it's not the company employing us but their client doing the sexism we're basically fucked right? And she can't go after every one of the disgusting pricks on the crew doing the same shit either",2023-02-08 23:44:26
7,( help us),"Well, for a start, if there’s anything good about this institution is that you learn how not to work cooperatively. They sell themselves as a place who values their teachers and crew members, always talking about team work, how we should communicate, etc. 
As we learn through life, most of these things are bullshit, they couldn’t care less about how you feel. It’s easy for me to sit down and talk about the things me and my co-workers went through there, that’s why I decided to highlight some of the things that have happened to us.

1- They don’t sign contracts with teacher assistants, they are forced to work crazy hours. Also they don’t have a steady schedule, sometimes they need to paint the walls, clean toys or just arrange the books in the library, even though it has nothing to do with their position.

2- teachers are forced to accept being hit and yelled by students and never do anything about it. 

3- we had a flood last year and people who missed work got an email talking about responsibilities around the school. Even though the whole city was under water ( basically)

4- the teachers cannot have fun in the malls or restaurants nearby, the owners don’t enjoy meeting the crew around ( even though it’s thei free time 🥴)

5- they force the kitchen staff to cook food for the students AND for their house, their own personal HOME Even on weekends

6- teachers cannot use the bathroom during classes.

7- if you’re sick you should still try to go to work because “the team needs you”

Among other things that makes this one of the worst places I’ve worked at. There’s no much I can do, but I learned they’re struggling getting new students, so we are trying to get our little revenge on them by taking their account down.
If anyone could take a minute or two to go on Instagram and reporting their account I’d be thankful.

8,Bullshit on your resume but learn the skill...,"I'll go straight to the point. This has been a proven working method for me. First I combine all of the job duties I ever had in my life for every job I held, align them and pick the 2 most relevant experiences to a specific job. Second thing is I then learn about a skill or do a quick udemy/coursera course about that specific job.(The courses are hacked courses I always get for free). Third thing is I boost the experience level by years and reword the ""Job position"". By doing these 3 things on my resume, I landed better paying jobs everytime. Then during the interview I try to ""educate"" the interviewer to show my grasp of the subject and how I would be the best fit for this role. Works everytime. Below is my greatest example of what I mean for the resume part:


Before:

- Title: Insurance Sales agent

- Experience: 3 months

- Duties: Insurance sales and promotion

- Salary associated: 100%



After:

- Title: Senior Insurance Executive

- Experience: 4 years(I always put 4 years for one or two experiences because it shows that you work for years and don't change jobs frequently)

- Duties: Tons of bullshits like, Generate leads, close sales, analyse risks

- Salary associated: 160%

- Skills I learned: Everything about insurance terms, concepts. Risk management, some finance courses and learned advance database usage like Excel(with formulas and shit) and others. Perfected my mail and phone etiquettes. And other skills linked to that role. 

- Status?: Landed the job but quit due to toxic work culture.",2023-02-08 15:05:47
9,now we're being told to LIE during the interview process,"https://www.dailydot.com/irl/5-things-you-should-lie-about-job-interview/?amp=#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16758777173145&csi=0&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com

Just came across this article (link provided above) that says we should lie about specific things during the interview for a prospective job.  Kinda tired of this. Why should I have to lie about a shitty manager or shitty co-workers if they made my job difficult? Why should I have to lie about what I do outside of work hours? All these businesses are complaining about people not wanting to work, then they want to go and be picky about shit that doesn't matter. It's none of your damn business what I do AFTER work, nor should that determine whether or not I have a job.",2023-02-08 13:51:49
10,Most recent job interview at Lowe's was whack,"It was one of those things I had to schedule online, select a time and date, etc. So never actually spoke to anyone before entering the store.


Everyone I met had a pretty rude attitude, which was already a red flag for a customer service position imo. Here's just a list of things I didn't like about this interview.


1. Emphasized more on making extra sales because bs about how it benefits the customer. (I was applying to be a cashier) Can't go anywhere these days without having extra shit shoved in your face, so I just don't wanna be a part of that anyways.


2. Didn't like that I was available literally every single day except Fridays. Was told I HAD to have all weekend availability, including Friday. I am a college student mind you.


3. I couldn't request a set amount of hours, like 15-20 being ideal for me. She just kinda told me you get what you get.


4. I was curious about the work environment because I didn't like the vibe, so I asked what it was like. She gave me some bs answer that ""it's what you make of it"". Tells me so much


5. She cut the interview off before I even had the chance to ask about pay but I don't really care since I think it would be a mistake to work here anyways.",2023-02-08 08:06:57
